# social-network-api

## Description

This project involves building an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The technology stack includes Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The goal is to create a flexible and efficient backend API for a social networking platform.

The motivation behind this project is to gain a deeper understanding of building APIs for social networking platforms. By working with MongoDB and Mongoose, the project aims to explore how to handle unstructured data efficiently, and how to create relationships between different data entities.

The project solves the problem of creating a backend system that can handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently. It focuses on providing the necessary API routes for users to interact with the platform, share thoughts, react to thoughts, and manage their friend list.

Through this project, I've learned how to design and implement API routes using Express.js, interact with a MongoDB database using Mongoose, manage relationships between different data models, and create a user-friendly API for a social networking platform.
